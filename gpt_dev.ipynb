        "\n",
        "ChatGPT is a **language model** — a neural network trained to predict the next word (or token) in a sequence.\n",
        "If you give it “Roses are red,” it learns to continue with “violets are blue.”\n",
        "\n",
        "This is called **language modeling.**\n",
        "Think of it as autocomplete on steroids: it tries to complete your text, one token at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "👉 When you ask ChatGPT to write a poem or answer a question, it doesn’t “look up” answers — it *predicts* plausible continuations based on all the text it’s seen.\n",

        "It introduced a neural architecture called the **Transformer**, which powers GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).\n",

        "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
        "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
        "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
        "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
        "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below"
